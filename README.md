Our project is a realtime chat based web app that lets people who are interested in learning languages chat with others in the same chat rooms. Once a user logs in they can select a room to join. Each room is for a specific language and everyone that joins that particular room has to speak that langauage. We also have user authentication. Each user can also track their langauge skill level and add friends.
